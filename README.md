## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install`
or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for
> your target environment.

## Prisma Setup

Follow these steps to initialize Prisma in your project:

1. Start by running Docker Compose to set up the PostgreSQL database for your development
   environment:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Run the Prisma migration command to apply database schema changes:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate
   ```

4. (Optional) Seed the database with initial data (no need to manually do it, since it's done
   automatically by the migrate command):

   ```bash
   npx prisma db seed
   ```

5. Your Prisma setup is now complete! You can start using the Prisma client in your application code
   to interact with the database.

Make sure to configure your database connection details and any other necessary settings in
the `.env` file before running the migration and seed commands.

For more information on Prisma and its usage, refer to
the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/).
